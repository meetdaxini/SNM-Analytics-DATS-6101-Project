# SNM-Analytics-DATS-6101-Project
This repository contains the group project for the DATS 6101 class by SNM Analytics, under the guidance of Professor Farhana Faruque. The project aims to analyze a dataset using various data science techniques and tools. The repository includes project documentation, code, and data files used in the analysis.

# Topic Proposal: Customer Churn Analysis in the Banking Industry

## Objective

The objective of this analysis is to determine how the distribution of credit score varies between customers who have churned and customers who have not churned, for customers with a balance greater than zero.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this analysis is the Churn Modelling dataset, which includes approximately 10,000 observations and 14 variables. The variables include customer demographic and transactional data like age, gender, tenure, balance, credit score, estimated salary, and categorical values like Geography, Gender, and HasCrCard.

The dataset can be found on Kaggle at the following link:

## Variables

The independent variable in this analysis is the credit score, a measure of creditworthiness and financial stability. The dependent variable is customer exited status, which takes the values as 1 if the customers left the bank and 0 if they stayed with the bank.

## Analysis

We will be conducting a classification analysis to explore the relationship between credit score and customer churn. Specifically, we will be comparing the distribution of credit scores for customers who have churned and customers who have not churned, for customers with a balance greater than zero.


## Conclusion

By analyzing the relationship between credit score and customer churn, we can gain insights into the factors that influence customer retention in the banking industry. The results of this analysis can be used to inform strategies for improving customer retention and profitability.
