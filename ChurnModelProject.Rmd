# 1.Introduction

Churn modeling is crucial for businesses as it helps identify factors that influence customer retention, enabling them to develop strategies to minimize churn and maintain profitability.

The dataset contains customer data, including demographic and financial information, along with a churn indicator of a Bank. These banks want to keep as many active clients as possible. Consequently, businesses want to know if their clients' demands are being satisfied or whether they'd like to quit the organization. If a bank thinks that a client is considering switching to another organization, the bank might take steps to persuade the client to stay. Dataset will be explored to understand the characteristics of the data, clean and prepare it for further analysis, and perform some statistical tests to draw insights.

The aim of this EDA is to find 'How does the distribution of credit score vary between customers who have churned and customers who have not churned, for customers with a balance greater than zero' using dataset of bank clients from https://www.kaggle.com/ (@shubh0799).

### 1.1 More information

A continuous variable, credit score allows us to calculate its mean, median, mode, standard deviation, and range for both groups. To see how credit scores are distributed, we may also generate histograms or density graphs. As the dataset contains data on customer demographics, transactions, and behaviors, we can quickly determine each customer's credit score and churn status. Moreover, the dataset may be filtered to only show clients that have balances that are larger than zero.

### 3.2 Cleaning dataset

```{r}
# Missing values in the dataset
null_count <- colSums(is.na(data))

cat("Missing values of RowNumber in the dataset:", sum(is.na(data$RowNumber)))
cat("\nMissing values of CustomerId in the dataset:", sum(is.na(data$CustomerId)))
cat("\nMissing values of Surname in the dataset:", sum(is.na(data$Surname)))
cat("\nMissing values of CreditScore in the dataset:", sum(is.na(data$CreditScore)))
cat("\nMissing values of Geography in the dataset:", sum(is.na(data$Geography)))
cat("\nMissing values of Gender in the dataset:", sum(is.na(data$Gender)))
cat("\nMissing values of Age in the dataset:", sum(is.na(data$Age)))
cat("\nMissing values of Tenure in the dataset:", sum(is.na(data$Tenure)))
cat("\nMissing values of Balance in the dataset:", sum(is.na(data$Balance)))
cat("\nMissing values of NumOfProducts in the dataset:", sum(is.na(data$NumOfProducts)))
cat("\nMissing values of HasCrCard in the dataset:", sum(is.na(data$HasCrCard)))
cat("\nMissing values of IsActiveMember in the dataset:", sum(is.na(data$IsActiveMember)))
cat("\nMissing values of EstimatedSalary in the dataset:", sum(is.na(data$EstimatedSalary)))
cat("\nMissing values of Exited in the dataset:", sum(is.na(data$Exited)))
```

The dataset contains 0 nulls.

```{r}
# Cleaning the dataset to remove unwanted variables

clean_data <- data %>%
  select(-RowNumber, -CustomerId, -Surname)
```

The selected variables(RowNumber, CustomerId, Surname) are removed from the dataset to gain more accurate insights on customer churn. 

```{r}
# Aligning the data according to the variable 'balance' and 'excited'
churn_data_filtered <- clean_data %>%
  filter(data$Balance > 0) %>%
  mutate(Churned = ifelse(Exited == 1, "Churned", "Not Churned"))

churned_data <- churn_data_filtered %>%
  filter(Churned == "Churned")

not_churned_data <- churn_data_filtered %>%
  filter(Churned == "Not Churned")

filter_rows <- nrow(churn_data_filtered)
```

This EDA looks at customers whose balance is greater than 0, as they are of more value to the bank who should be retained. After cleaning the data, the number of observations are **`r filter_rows``**.

```{r}
# Outliers are removed to analyze the dataset more accurately
data_variables <- c("CreditScore", "Age", "Tenure", "Balance", "NumOfProducts", "EstimatedSalary")

for (var in data_variables) {
  p1 <- ggplot(churn_data_filtered, aes_string(x = var)) +
    geom_histogram(bins=30, fill = "blue", color = "black") +
    labs(title = paste("Histogram of", var), x = var, y = "Frequency")

  p2 <- ggplot(churn_data_filtered, aes_string(x = "1", y = var)) +
    stat_boxplot(geom = "errorbar") +
    geom_boxplot(fill = "green", color = "black") +
    labs(title = paste("Boxplot of", var), x = "", y = var) +
    theme(axis.title.x = element_blank(), axis.text.x = element_blank(), axis.ticks.x = element_blank())

  gridExtra::grid.arrange(p1, p2, ncol = 2)
}

```

```{r}
# Remove Outliers

no_credscore_out = outlierKD2(churn_data_filtered,CreditScore,rm = TRUE,boxplt = TRUE,histogram = TRUE,qqplt = T)
no_age_out = outlierKD2(churn_data_filtered,Age,rm = TRUE,boxplt = TRUE,histogram = TRUE,qqplt = T)
no_tenure_out = outlierKD2(churn_data_filtered,Tenure,rm = TRUE,boxplt = TRUE,histogram = TRUE,qqplt = T)
no_bal_out = outlierKD2(churn_data_filtered,Balance,rm = TRUE,boxplt = TRUE,histogram = TRUE,qqplt = T)
no_nop_out = outlierKD2(churn_data_filtered,NumOfProducts,rm = TRUE,boxplt = TRUE,histogram = TRUE,qqplt = T)
no_estsal_out = outlierKD2(churn_data_filtered,EstimatedSalary,rm = TRUE,boxplt = TRUE,histogram = TRUE,qqplt = T)

no_out_data <- c(no_credscore_out, no_age_out, no_tenure_out, no_bal_out, no_nop_out, no_estsal_out)
```

### 3.3 Basic statistics

```{r}
# Calculate summary statistics by Exited
credit_score_summary <- churn_data_filtered %>%
  group_by(Exited) %>%
  summarize(
    mean_credit_score = mean(CreditScore),
    sd_credit_score = sd(CreditScore),
    min_credit_score = min(CreditScore),
    max_credit_score = max(CreditScore)
  )

age_summary <- churn_data_filtered %>%
  group_by(Exited) %>%
  summarize(
    mean_age = mean(Age),
    sd_age = sd(Age),
    min_age = min(Age),
    max_age = max(Age)
  )

bal_summary <- churn_data_filtered %>%
  group_by(Exited) %>%
  summarize(
    mean_bal = mean(Balance),
    sd_bal = sd(Balance),
    min_bal = min(Balance),
    max_bal = max(Balance)
  )

estsal_summary <- churn_data_filtered %>%
  group_by(Exited) %>%
  summarize(
    mean_estsal = mean(EstimatedSalary),
    sd_estsal = sd(EstimatedSalary),
    min_estsal = min(EstimatedSalary),
    max_estsal = max(EstimatedSalary)
  )

# Print summary table
t1 <- xkabledply(credit_score_summary)
t2 <-xkabledply(age_summary)
t3 <-xkabledply(bal_summary)
t4 <-xkabledply(estsal_summary)
```
Summary of Credit score, age, balance, estimated salary are: 
`r t1`
`r t2`
`r t3`
`r t4`

The summary is calculated on the dataset that includes customers with a balance greater than zero and without removing any outliers. The summary consists of the following columns:

- `Exited`: Churn status (0 for not churned, 1 for churned)
- `mean_credit_score`: Mean credit score for each group
- `sd_credit_score`: Standard deviation of credit scores for each group
- `min_credit_score`: Minimum credit score for each group
- `max_credit_score`: Maximum credit score for each group
- `mean_age`: Mean age for each group
- `sd_age`: Standard deviation of age for each group
- `min_age`: Minimum age for each group
- `max_age`: Maximum age for each group
- `mean_bal`: Mean balance for each group
- `sd_bal`: Standard deviation of balance for each group
- `min_bal`: Minimum balance for each group
- `max_bal`: Maximum balance for each group
- `mean_estsal`: Mean estimated salary for each group
- `sd_estsal`: Standard deviation of estimated salary for each group
- `min_estsal`: Minimum estimated salary for each group
- `max_estsal`: Maximum estimated salary for each group

```

```{r}
ggplot(data = churn_data_filtered, aes(x = Churned, y = CreditScore, fill = Churned)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("#F8766D", "#00BFC4")) +
  labs(title = "Comparison of Credit Score for Churned and Not Churned Customers",
       x = "",
       y = "Credit Score") +
  theme_bw()
```

### 3.4 Simple correlations and tests

We will perform an independent two-sample t-test to determine if there is a significant difference in the mean credit scores between customers who churned and those who did not churn.

H0: The mean credit scores of churned customers and non-churned customers are equal.
H1: The mean credit scores of churned customers and non-churned customers are not equal.

```{r}
churned <- churned_data %>% pull(CreditScore)
not_churned <- not_churned_data %>% pull(CreditScore)

ttest_result <- t.test(churned, not_churned)

# Display t-test results
ttest_result
```

# 4.Conclusion

Since the p-value `r ttest_result$p.value` is less than 0.05, we reject the null hypothesis. The mean credit scores of churned customers and non-churned customers are not equal.
